# Video Game Sales Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyzed video game sales data from 1980 to 2016 taken from the website vgchartz.com and suggested measures a video game retailer may take to increase their sales revenue in the next few years. 

## Business Overview
We are approaching this project from the view of a video game retailer. We want to understand future trends in the global and regional video game industries, so that we can capitalize on these trends to boost our sales revenue. 
To achieve our goal of understanding future trends, we can ask the following questions:
1. What is the current trend of the video game sales industry? What kind of video games are expected to be popular in the future?
2. If we are looking to expand our business overseas, what are some regional trends we should take note of?

## Data Understanding
The data being analyzed is video game sales data from 1980 to 2016 taken from Kaggle (here)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings]. It is a record of video game sales scraped from the website (vgchartz.com)[https://www.vgchartz.com] and their corresponding MetaCritic scores and ESRB ratings.

As a note, our data may be out of date for 2023, however for the sake of this project, let's assume that the 'current time' takes place in 2017, just after the collection of the data.

## Analysis
Through data analysis, we discovered a few things.

The peak of total global sales as well as the highest number of game releases were in 2008-2009. Since then the video game industry appears to be in a decline. Almost 50% of all video game revenue is generated from customers in North America, while Europe and Japan account for ~25% and ~15% respectively.

However, most of the revenue from video game sales is generated by a small number of hit games that sell for more than 10x other games.

On average, gaming platforms, and especially consoles, tend to last around 6 years. However there are outliers present, such as the PC and the DS.

We found that the most popular genres of games in Europe and North America from 2011-2016 are Action and Shooter games. On the other hand, customers from Japan appear to prefer Role-Playing and Actions Games.

There is also difference in terms of platform choice and preferred publisher between Japanese and Western customers. For example, Japanese customers also strongly prefer Japan-made platforms and games from Japanese publishers, while Western customers do not appear to have the same regional tribalism in these categories. As shown below, all 10 of the top 10 publishers in Japan are Japanese. Conversely, The Top 10 publishers in Europe and North America feature publishers across the ocean. Likely, this difference in publisher preference is related to the difference in game genre preference across the regions. For example, Western publishers may publish Shooter games which are popular with their western playerbase, but they will not find as much popularity in Japan where the preference for Shooter games is lower. Similarly, Japanese video game publishers may publish more Role-Playing games to cater to their Japanese audience, and thus lose out of western customers.

Finally, we discovered that while user score is often reflective of critic score, neither metric has a significant impact on whether a game is popular or not. In general, there is a very weak correlation between critic score and video game sales. 

## Conclusion
**Are video game sales likely to be profitable in the near future? If so, what kind of video games are expected to be popular?**
- It is clear that the video game industry is in decline. If the video game retailer wishes to continue in this line of business, we would recommend that they diversify their source of revenue. For example, they might want to implement joint promotions with partner shops that sell gaming-related products, like energy drinks or gaming peripherals.
- Also, in searching for upcoming popular video games to retail, it is not advisable for the retailer to depend on the critic and user scores to determine popularity. The retailer should instead pay attention to the genre, publisher and platform of the video game. Specifically, console games of Action, Shooter and Role-playing genres. As video game sales are clustered amongst only a small number of hit games, it is especially important to bet correctly on upcoming popular video games.

**If the retailer is looking to expand their business overseas, is there anything they should take note of?**
- The preferences of North America and European consumers are similar in preference, so marketing strategies and promotions may work well between the two regions.
- Howeever, Japanese consumers stand out in terms of platform choice and preferred genre. Thus when conducting business with each region, it may be beneficial to consider the historical and cultural differences as they are reflected in the players' preferences.
